Framing the Problem:

1. Problem recognition:
  -> What is the Business problem that you can analyze from this dataset? Why is it relevant?

2. Review of Previous findings:
  -> What does your research guide you into? Are there key insights that you found from your research about the Busines problem?

  -> What is the Testable Hypothesis / Thought process that you established based on your initial research? 

Solving the Problem:

1. Variable Selection: 
  -> Introduce your Data using key attributes. What is the data about?

2. Data collection: 
  -> What are the data sources that you collected?

3. Data Analysis: 
  -> Summarization and Visualization (5-7 charts / analyses)
  -> What are the key trends and patterns that you find about the data?
  -> How does it add value to your Data Analysis project?
  -> Are there Outliers in your data? What charts/visualization did you use to identify them? How did you handle your Outliers?
  -> What are the updates/ modifications that you did to your initial hypothesis/ thought process after Summarization and Visualization?

Modelling and Communication:

1. Modelling: (OLS and / Logistic) to identify relations /connections in the data

2. Results presentation:
  -> Validate your Hypothesis / thought process. What are your inferences / model performance?
  -> Preparing your R markdown for presentation
  -> What are your 3# specific insights for the data analysis? Connect your data analysis from Stage 1 and Modelling from Stage 3 to support your findings.
