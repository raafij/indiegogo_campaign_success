# Indiegogo Campaign Success Rate

As part of the Data Analytics: R class, teams were tasked with identifying a business need and creating an analysis to try to solve the business need.

The data that was chosen by our team is based on the success rate on projects that are uploaded to Indiegogo, an online platform that serves as a crowd funding for projects, products and services.

We will be finding the determining variables that lead to the highest success rate for Indiegogo campaigns from 2017-2019 (which is a 10-year overview)

## Assignment Instructions:

Framing the Problem:

1. Problem recognition:
  -> What is the Business problem that you can analyze from this dataset? Why is it relevant?

2. Review of Previous findings:
  -> What does your research guide you into? Are there key insights that you found from your research about the Busines problem?

  -> What is the Testable Hypothesis / Thought process that you established based on your initial research? 

Solving the Problem:

1. Variable Selection: 
  -> Introduce your Data using key attributes. What is the data about?

2. Data collection: 
  -> What are the data sources that you collected?

3. Data Analysis: 
  -> Summarization and Visualization (5-7 charts / analyses)
  -> What are the key trends and patterns that you find about the data?
  -> How does it add value to your Data Analysis project?
  -> Are there Outliers in your data? What charts/visualization did you use to identify them? How did you handle your Outliers?
  -> What are the updates/ modifications that you did to your initial hypothesis/ thought process after Summarization and Visualization?

Modelling and Communication:

1. Modelling: (OLS and / Logistic) to identify relations /connections in the data

2. Results presentation:
  -> Validate your Hypothesis / thought process. What are your inferences / model performance?
  -> Preparing your R markdown for presentation
  -> What are your 3# specific insights for the data analysis? Connect your data analysis from Stage 1 and Modelling from Stage 3 to support your findings.
